🚨 Problem Statement: 1930 Helpline Improvement 🚨

Problem Statement: The problem revolves around improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the 1930 Helpline, a crucial communication channel for reporting cybercrimes and freezing funds related to these crimes. The current problem lies in the complex legal provisions, limited reach, lack of awareness, and financial constraints connected with the helpline. Additionally, there's a need for a streamlined method to recover frozen funds due to cyber fraud, as the current legal provisions (Section 102 of the Criminal Procedure Code) can lead to delays and stress for complainants.

Solution:

Developing an Automated Recovery Platform to simplify fund recovery post-1930 complaints. Thus, easing the complexities associated with Section 102 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CRPC). Implementing the below mentioned solution steps by creating an AI-Powered Legal Decision System to streamline legal steps for fund recovery, simplifying the process and mitigating delays and distrust. 🤖💼

Also, to enhance the helpline accessibility across diverse regions, we can raise awareness to encourage reporting of cyber fraud cases as soon as people encounter it. 🌐📢

Process Flow:

Step 1: Helpline Call and SMS Notification
As soon as an individual calls the helpline (1930), an automated SMS with a link to the website is dispatched to the caller's phone. 📞📲

Step 2: Form Submission and AI Integration
Upon tapping the link, a comprehensive form including crucial details is filled out by the complainant. AI algorithms analyze the complaint and automatically add necessary legal sections. 📝🤖

Step 3: Email Notification to Local Police Station
After form submission, a notification is sent via email to the respective local police station containing a copy of the complaint for filing an e-FIR, bypassing the need for the complainant's physical presence. 📧👮

Step 4: SMS Confirmation and Account Handling Instructions
The complainant receives an SMS with a complaint number, acknowledgment number, and guidance to transfer remaining funds to a secure account and block the compromised account to prevent further loss. 📲💸

Step 5: Automated Ticket Generation for Fund Recovery
Utilizing the transaction ID, an automated ticket is raised to the concerned bank or e-wallet operator where the fraudulent transfer occurred. 🎫💳

Step 6: Account Freeze and Fund Reversion
Upon ticket creation, the bank or e-wallet operator verifies the transaction details. If the funds are available, the account is frozen, and the money is reverted to the source account. ❄️💰

In cases where the funds are not available in the flagged account but have been transferred to another account, there are several actions that can be taken:

Tracing Funds: Initiate a process to track the transferred funds, collaborating with banks and financial institutions to follow the transaction trail. 🕵️‍♂️💼
Legal Notifications: Notify authorities and financial institutions of the fraudulent transaction, providing evidence to aid investigations. 🚨📑
Freezing Destination Account: Identify the receiving account and potentially freeze it to halt further fund movement, facilitating potential recovery. ❄️🛑
Legal Proceedings: Initiate legal actions against the involved individuals/entities for the fraudulent transfer, supported by evidence and documentation. ⚖️📂
